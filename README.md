# digital-namecard

A simple html page displaying a digital namecard, intended to be hosted as a [github page](https://pmorrison2000.github.io/digital-namecard/).

This gives me a single url I can use in NFC cards and rings. Make those cardboard business cards obsolete!


Forked from a Preston Lim's repo, [digital-namecard](https://github.com/prestonlimlianjie/digital-namecard) after coming across his very clear instructions in a medium post, [Hack Your Life: How to make your own Digital Business Card](https://medium.com/@prestonlim/hack-your-life-how-to-make-your-own-digital-business-card-7a26ac400933)
